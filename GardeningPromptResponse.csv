What is an USDA Hardiness Zone?,"The USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map is the standard by which gardeners and growers can determine which perennial plants are most likely to thrive at a location. For an up to date map and more information, visit https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/"
What is an annual plant?,"True annuals are plants that germinate, flower, set seed, and die all in one season. Their ultimate goal is to reproduce themselves (set seed), which is good news for gardeners because most annuals will flower like mad until their mission is accomplished"
What categories of annual plants exist?,"Hardy (cool-season), Tender (warm-season), and Half-Hardy"
Are annuals better than perennials?,Annuals allow gardeners to focus on growing one season at a time where as perennials require longer term planning but perennials will produce for more seasons as a result.
What is a perennial?,"Perennials are typically cold-hardy plants that will return again the next Spring. They normally bloom during one specific season (Spring, Summer or Fall)"
How long will a perennial last?,Perennials complete a growth cycle in 3 or more years.
When to plant Hardy Annuals? ,Spring or early fall. Seeds can be sown in winter in some climates.
When to plant Half-Hardy or Tender Annuals?,"Any time from late spring to midsummer, as long as there is little danger of frost."
When to plant Perennials?,Spring or early fall is best. It is difficult for plants to become established during the heat of the summer.
What is the life span of Hardy Annuals?,"Typically one growing season, although they may self-sow and return for a second season."
What is the life span of Half-Hardy or Tender Annuals?,One growing season.
What is the life span of Perennials?,Three or more years.
What is the cold hardiness of Hardy Annuals?,Cold-tolerant; can handle a slight freeze.
What is the cold hardiness of Half-Hardy or Tender Annuals?,Intolerant of freezing temperatures.
What is the cold hardiness of perennials?,"Varies, but most plants can survive cold winters."
What are the benefits of Hardy Annuals?,"They thrive early and late in the season, when temperatures are too cool for most tender annuals."
What are the benefits of Half-Hardy or Tender Annuals?,"Half-Hardy or Tender Annuals are great additions to containers or a garden full of perennials, adding nearly instant color when perennials have stopped blooming for the season."
What are the benefits of Perennials?,"Perennials provide a sense of continuity from year to year. Although they typically bloom for just a few weeks, their foliage and form contribute to the beauty of the garden throughout the year."
What about Tulips?," Although most bulbs are considered to be perennials, tulips are often an exception. Native to Central Asia, they require cold winters and hot, dry summers to return each year. But in climates that don’t offer these conditions, they don’t rebloom reliably and are often treated as annuals."
What about Tender Perennials?,"These tender perennials, sometimes called “temperennials,"" are winter hardy in warmer growing zones but not in northern gardens, where they are typically grown as annuals or even houseplants. Many succulents and tropical plants fit into this category, such as begonias, Alternanthera, elephant ears, and agave."
What kind of soil should I use for annuals?,Annuals prefer well-drained soil with a pH between 6.3 and 6.7
What is well-drained soil?,Well drained soil is soil that is quickly absorbs water but sheds excess water quickly without allowing it to pool up.
How can I improve soil drainage?,Using additives such as perlite or vermiculite can improve water drainage and mineral retention.
What is compost?,Composting is the natural process of recycling organic matter such as leaves and food scraps into valuable fertilizer for plants.
What kind of soil should I use for perennials?,"Perennials prefer well drained, fertilized soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0."
What are the benefits of composting?,"Composting is a great way to recycle the organic waste we generate at home. Food scraps and garden waste combined make up more than 28 percent of what we throw away, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)."
How does organic material turn into compost?,"Anything that grows decomposes eventually; composting simply speeds up the process by providing an ideal environment for bacteria, fungi, and other decomposing organisms (such as worms, sowbugs, and nematodes) to do their work."
